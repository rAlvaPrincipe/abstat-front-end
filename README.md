# ABSTAT Front-end

ABSTAT is a powerful tool designed to provide statistical profiles of RDF knowledge graphs, offering users a compact yet comprehensive way to analyze and manage semantic data. This repo contains the front-end module. For the the core algorithms and back-end please refer to the [**Backend Repository**](https://github.com/rAlvaPrincipe/abstat-distributed).
