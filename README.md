# ABSTAT (Front-end Application)

ABSTAT is a powerful tool designed to provide statistical profiles of RDF knowledge graphs, offering users a compact and comprehensive way to analyze and manage semantic data.  
This repository contains the front-end module.  
- For the back-end application, please refer to the [**ABSTAT (Back-end Application) Repository**](https://bitbucket.org/disco_unimib/abstat).
- For core algorithms, please refer to the [**ABSTAT-HD Repository**](https://bitbucket.org/disco_unimib/abstat-distributed).

## Dependencies

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before proceeding:

- **Node.js**
- **Angular CLI**

## Installation and Build

Follow these steps to set up and build the ABSTAT front-end:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   $ ./install.sh
   ```
3. Build the project with the desired configuration mode:
   ```bash
   $ ng build --configuration=<mode>
   ```
   

### Configuration Modes:
- **public**: Suitable for a read-only ABSTAT deployment.
- **full-open**: Enables all features for an open deployment.
- **full-closed**: Enables all features with authentication required.

4. Configure the backend settings by updating the `BACKEND` and `CLUSTER_BACKEND` variables in the `abstat-front-end/src/app/auth.constant.ts` file.
